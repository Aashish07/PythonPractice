# PythonPractice

1. Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. 

## Variables 

#### In other programming languages like C, C++, and Java, you will need to declare the type of variables but in Python you donâ€™t need to do that. Just type in the variable and when values will be given to it, then it will automatically know whether the value given would be an int, float, or char or even a String.
