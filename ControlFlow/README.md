Different looping techniques using Python data structures  are: 

1. Using enumerate():
    enumerate() is used to loop through the containers printing the index number along with the value present in that particular index.

2. Using zip():
    zip() is used to combine 2 similar containers(list-list or dict-dict) printing the values sequentially.
    The loop exists only till the smaller container ends. 

3. Using iteritem():
    iteritems() is used to loop through the dictionary printing the dictionary key-value pair sequentially.

4. 
5. Using sorted():
    sorted() is used to print the container is sorted order. 
    It doesnâ€™t sort the container but just prints the container in sorted order for 1 instance. 
    The use of set() can be combined to remove duplicate occurrences.
6. Using reversed():
    reversed() is used to print the values of the container in the reversed order.
    It does not reflect any changes to the original list
