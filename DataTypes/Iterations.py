# Iterations or looping can be performed in python by ‘for’ and ‘while’ loops. 
# Apart from iterating upon a particular condition, we can also iterate on strings, lists, and tuples.

# 1. While loop :-----
    i = 1
    while (i < 10): 
        print(i) 
        i += 1

    # Output :- 
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

# 2. For loop :-----

    s = "Hello World"
    for i in s : 
        print (i) 

# 3. For loop on list :------

    L = [1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9] 
    for  i in L: 
        print (i) 

# 4. For loop with range :------

    for i in range(0, 10): 
        print (i)
