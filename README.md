# PythonPractice

1. Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. 

## Variables 

#### In other programming languages like C, C++, and Java, you will need to declare the type of variables but in Python you don’t need to do that. Just type in the variable and when values will be given to it, then it will automatically know whether the value given would be an int, float, or char or even a String.

Python program to declare variables :-
myNumber = 3
print(myNumber) 


## DataStructure

#### List is the most basic Data Structure in python. List is a mutable data structure i.e items can be added to list later after the list creation. It’s like you are going to shop at the local market and made a list of some items and later on you can add more and more items to the list. append() function is used to add data to the list.

Python program to illustrate a list :-
  
1. creates a empty list 
nums = []  
  
2. appending data in list 
nums.append(21) 
nums.append(40.5) 
nums.append("String") 
  
print(nums)
